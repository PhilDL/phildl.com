I recently stumle upon this google slides https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1KIksFM5IuCvLP2y-sxjkcBlpnrAX9VcBhYgKvMou5-0/mobilepresent?pli=1&slide=id.gc7f9aff66a_0_5 and I think it is a very good presentation about the misconception of Odoo developpers about the OWL framework.

Lots of problems with these slides but especially:

- These examples use Bus a lot which is not part of OWL anymore...
- Slide 52 : Auction Item trigger change_screen custom events... this is fucking stupid, it should take the function callback instead declaratively instead of using a side effects.
- Slide 57 : onMounted + setInterval for a Timer: Wrong use, should be useEffect no deps.

```ts twoslash
type Indices<L extends number, T extends number[] = []> = T["length"] extends L
  ? T[number]
  : Indices<L, [T["length"], ...T]>;

type LengthAtLeast<T extends readonly any[], L extends number> = Pick<Required<T>, Indices<L>>;

/**
 * TypeScript type narrowing assert helper function to help with noUncheckedIndexedAccess.
 * Only usable on small array index checking (0-4). If you need to check a larger
 * array, please review your implementation and use a loop instead.
 *
 * @example
 * const names = ["John", "Doe"];
 * if (assertLengthAtLeast(names, 2)) {
 *  console.log(names[1]); // no error
 * }
 *
 */
export function assertLengthAtLeast<T extends readonly any[], I extends 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4>(
  array: T,
  length: I,
): array is T & LengthAtLeast<T, I> {
  return array.length >= length;
}

// ---cut---
// @noUncheckedIndexedAccess: true
// @errors: 2322

const names = ["John", "Doe"];
let secondName: string;

if (names.length >= 2) {
  secondName = names[1];
}

if (assertLengthAtLeast(names, 2)) {
  secondName = names[1];
}
```

## Why do you keep bubbling up event to change state ?
